# Zomato Restaurant Analysis

This project involved analyzing Zomato restaurant data using advanced Excel functions and SQL queries, and creating interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI and Tableau. 

The objectives of the project were:
1. Building a Calendar Table using the Column Datekey and adding columns such as Year, Monthno, Monthfullname, Quarter(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4), YearMonth ( YYYY-MMM), Weekdayno, Weekday name, Financial Month ( April = FM1, May= FM2  â€¦. March = FM12) and Financial Quarter ( Quarters based on Financial Month FQ-1 . FQ-2..).
2. Finding the Numbers of Resturants based on City and Country.
3. Finding numbers of resturants opening based on Year , Quarter , Month
4. Count of Resturants based on Average Ratings
5. Creating buckets based on Average Price of reasonable size and find out how many resturants falls in each buckets
6. Finding percentage of Resturants based on "Has_Table_booking"
8. Finding percentage of Resturants based on "Has_Online_delivery"
9. Developing Charts based on Cusines, City, Ratings
10. Building a dashboard in Excel, Tableau and Power BI for the KPI's above.

The project showcases the use of Excel, SQL, and dashboard tools such as Power BI and Tableau for data analysis and visualization, and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about these tools and techniques.

Excel To achieve the objectives of the Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project, various advanced Excel functions were used, including:

SUMIFS and COUNTIFS functions to extract and count data based on specific criteria PivotTables and PivotCharts to summarize and analyze data Conditional formatting to highlight key insights in the data Report connections to link multiple PivotTables and charts to a single slicer, allowing for dynamic filtering of the data VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH functions to merge data from different tables DATE and YEAR functions to extract information from date fields

SQL To extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset, SQL queries were executed using the following keywords:

SELECT to retrieve data from specific columns FROM to specify the table to retrieve data from WHERE to filter data based on specific conditions GROUP BY to group data based on specific columns ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order HAVING to filter data based on aggregated values Window functions, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, to perform calculations on subsets of data Date functions, such as DATEADD, DATEDIFF, and DATEPART, to extract information from date fields and perform date calculations

Power BI To visualize and analyze the Zomato restaurant data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards. The following features and functions were utilized:

Data modeling using relationships between tables and calculated columns Measures and DAX formulas to perform calculations on the data Visualizations such as tables, charts, and maps to display the data Slicers and filters to enable dynamic filtering of the data Drill-through functionality to navigate between different levels of detail in the data

Tableau In addition to Power BI, Tableau was also used to create interactive dashboards for the Zomato restaurant data analysis project. The following features and functions were utilized:

Data blending to combine data from different tables Calculated fields to perform calculations on the data Dimensions and measures to organize and analyze the data Visualizations such as maps, charts, and tables to display the data Filters and parameters to enable dynamic filtering of the data
